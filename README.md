# A-Verilog-VHDL-design-using-python

Myhdl turns Python into the hardware description and verification languages, verilog or VHDL, and provides a single platform to test the function of your design. Today we use 2 examples, a delay flip-flop as a sequential logic circuit, and a adder as a combinational logic circuit, to show the convinience using Myhdl to help you design.<br>
This repository gives you the python codes which generated the dff & adder, and for showing the result, we also give the verilog & VHDL code generated by Myhdl based on python. What's more, the 2 png files are vcd form test wave we can see on quartus, and we save them as pictures, so that your guys can view the result more directly.<br>
